# Market Signals - Value Proposition

## What This Platform Does

Market Signals analyzes MLS listing data to surface **actionable opportunities** that traditional MLS search misses.

### For Buyers 🏠

**Problem**: Searching Zillow/Redfin shows you thousands of listings, but which ones are actually good deals?

**Solution**: Market Signals tells you:

- **Price Reductions** - Properties with recent price drops (motivated sellers)
- **Underpriced Listings** - Priced below comparable homes in the same neighborhood/price band
- **Long on Market** - Properties sitting longer than average (more negotiating room)
- **Back on Market** - Deals that fell through (second chance opportunities)
- **New Listings** - Fresh properties before they get crowded with offers

**Example**: Instead of browsing 200 condos in Boston, you get alerts for the 7 condos that are:

- Priced 10% below similar units in the same building
- Just had a price drop this week
- Sitting for 60+ days (sellers likely anxious)

### For Sellers 📊

**Problem**: When should I list? Am I priced right? Is my agent being honest?

**Solution**: Market Signals shows you:

- **Market Velocity** - How fast similar homes are selling in your area
- **Price Trends** - Are sellers cutting prices? Are listings sitting?
- **Your Position** - Where you'd sit relative to comparable active listings
- **Timing Signals** - When the market shifts from hot to soft

**Example**: You're thinking of selling your Watertown SF home for $1.2M. Market Signals shows:

- 5 similar homes listed higher cut their price 8% in the last 30 days
- Average DOM jumped from 15 to 45 days
- Only 2 homes sold in the last month (vs 8 last year)
  → **Signal**: Wait 2 months or price aggressively at $1.1M

### For Agents/Investors 💼

**Problem**: Monitoring 20+ towns manually is impossible. By the time you see a deal, it's gone.

**Solution**: Automated monitoring across multiple markets with smart filters:

- Track specific neighborhoods, property types, and price ranges
- Get daily digests of new opportunities ranked by signal strength
- Spot market shifts before your competitors (price cut waves, inventory buildups)
- Focus on high-probability leads instead of cold calling

**Example**: Investor tracks 15 towns for multi-families under $600K with "likely price cut" signals:

- Gets 2-3 leads per week that meet criteria
- Properties have been sitting 90+ days and are overpriced vs comps
- Investor makes lowball offers knowing sellers are desperate
- Closes 1-2 deals per quarter from the pipeline

## How It's Different from MLS Alerts

| Traditional MLS Alert                               | Market Signals                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Email me when a 3-bed condo under $500K is listed" | "Email me when a 3-bed condo is **underpriced**, had a **price drop**, or is **sitting too long**" |
| Shows you everything (noisy)                        | Shows you opportunities (high signal)                                                              |
| Reactive (you see it when everyone else does)       | Proactive (you see patterns before they're obvious)                                                |
| Price threshold only                                | Price + market context (DOM, comps, trends)                                                        |
| No explanation why it matters                       | Each signal has a reason and suggested action                                                      |

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. First-Time Buyer with Budget Constraints

- **Goal**: Find a starter home in Arlington under $600K
- **Challenge**: Only 2-3 new listings per month in that range
- **Solution**: Set alert for "underpriced" OR "price reduction" in Arlington SF under $600K
- **Result**: Gets notified of 1-2 opportunities per month that have better odds of accepting a lower offer

### 2. Agent Managing 20 Buyer Clients

- **Goal**: Send relevant listings to clients without spamming them
- **Challenge**: Can't manually review 100+ new listings per week across 10 towns
- **Solution**: Create 20 alerts (one per client) with their specific criteria + signal filters
- **Result**: Each client gets 3-5 highly relevant listings per week instead of 30 generic ones

### 3. Seller Timing the Market

- **Goal**: Decide when to list their Brookline condo
- **Challenge**: Should they list now or wait? What price?
- **Solution**: Check Market Signals dashboard for Brookline condos weekly
- **Result**: Sees when price cut activity spikes (soft market) vs when things move fast (hot market); lists accordingly

### 4. Investor Looking for Distressed Deals

- **Goal**: Find motivated sellers willing to accept below-market offers
- **Challenge**: Most "distressed" properties are gone before they hear about them
- **Solution**: Alert for properties with 3+ signals: "long on market" + "price reduction" + "overpriced"
- **Result**: Focuses on 2-3 truly desperate sellers per month instead of wasting time on 50 tire-kickers

## Key Differentiators

1. **Baseline-Aware**: Compares each listing to its town/type/price-band peers (not the whole city)
2. **Multi-Signal**: Combines time-on-market, price movements, and relative pricing (not just one metric)
3. **Proactive**: Alerts you to opportunities, not just listings
4. **Actionable**: Each signal suggests what to do (negotiate, move fast, wait, etc.)
5. **Context**: Shows _why_ a listing matters, not just _that_ it exists

## Bottom Line

**If you only care about "show me 3-bed condos under $500K"**, use Zillow.

**If you want to know "which 3-bed condos are actually good deals, priced to move, or from motivated sellers"**, use Market Signals.
